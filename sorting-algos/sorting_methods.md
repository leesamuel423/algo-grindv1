# Sorting Methods

## Selection Sort

• Works through repeatedly selecting smallest (or largest) element from unsorted portion of list and moving it to sorted portion of list
• Time Complexity: O(N^2)
• Space Complexity: O(1)

### Advantages vs Disadvantages

• Simple and easy to understand
• Works will with small dataset

• Time complexity of O(N^2) is a bit too high, and thus doesn't work well on large datasets
• Does not preserve relative order of items with equal keys (unstable sorting method)
